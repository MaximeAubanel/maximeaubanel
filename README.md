It is a **Go** program launching and managing severals **Docker Containers** :whale: **Telemetry**, **Commands** and **Navigation** are our main docker containers and each of them is in fact a **ROS node developed in C++**. Each Onboard Computer is connected to the cloud via a 2 way communication layer with our VPN. Finally, I setup our **CI/CD platform**, in order to build and deploy our docker images in our registry for **AMD64** and **ARM64** architecture whenever unit tests are passed after a successful release.</samp>
