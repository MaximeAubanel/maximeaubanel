### Work Experience

> <samp>**2020** - :switzerland: - **Robotics Software Engineer** - [@rigi.tech](https://www.rigi.tech/)<samp>

<samp>**Designed and developed** from scratch the **ROS ecosystem** and **communications layers** into our drone fleet. Every drone has an **Onboard Computer (Raspberry Pi)** - connected to an **Autopilot (PX4)** - running our **Onboard Software**. It is a **Go** program launching and managing severals **Docker Containers** :whale: **Telemetry**, **Commands** and **Navigation** are our main docker containers and each of them is in fact a **ROS node developed in C++**. Each Onboard Computer is connected to the cloud via a 2 way communication layer with our VPN. Finally, I setup our **CI/CD platform**, in order to build and deploy our docker images in our registry for **AMD64** and **ARM64** architecture whenever unit tests are passed after a successful release.</samp>
